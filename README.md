## **Theory of programming languages and methods of translation**

As part of my master program in CS I had a very interesting though challenging course called
_**'Theory of programming languages and methods of translation'**_

I really hated it at first but then fell in love with this course! 

I discovered many useful aspects 
and patterns which helped me to understand and therefor use Python better.

In this repo I saved some tasks we were given during the course and important theoretical points. I hope that you will find it useful.

**âœ¨ Enjoy âœ¨**
